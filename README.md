# Predicting Customer Interest in Health Insurance Cross-Sell
# Problem Statement
To maximize revenue, insurance companies often cross-sell additional products to existing customers. This project aims to predict which health insurance customers are likely to purchase vehicle insurance.
# Objective
1. Data Imbalance: The dataset may have an unequal distribution of interested versus uninterested customers, potentially leading to biased model predictions.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating and identifying relevant features that can enhance model accuracy.
3. Scalability: Ensuring the model's efficiency in handling large datasets.
4. Model Evaluation: Choosing appropriate metrics, such as precision, to accurately measure the model's ability to predict true positives while minimizing false positives.
# Deliverables
A machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of a customer responding positively to a vehicle insurance cross-sell offer.

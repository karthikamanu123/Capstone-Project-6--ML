# Predicting Customer Interest in Health Insurance Cross-Sell
# Problem Statement
To maximize revenue, insurance companies often cross-sell additional products to existing customers. This project aims to predict which health insurance customers are likely to purchase vehicle insurance.
# Objective
1. Data Imbalance: The dataset may have an unequal distribution of interested versus uninterested customers, potentially leading to biased model predictions.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating and identifying relevant features that can enhance model accuracy.
3. Scalability: Ensuring the model's efficiency in handling large datasets.
4. Model Evaluation: Choosing appropriate metrics, such as precision, to accurately measure the model's ability to predict true positives while minimizing false positives.
# Deliverables
A machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of a customer responding positively to a vehicle insurance cross-sell offer.

A comprehensive report detailing:

1.Data preprocessing steps

2.Feature engineering techniques

3.Model selection and optimization

4.Performance evaluation using appropriate metrics

5.Key business insights derived from the model's predictions

# Model Performance
The final model achieved the following performance metrics:

1.Accuracy: 94.89%

2.Recall: 99.82%

3.Precision: 90.88%

4.F1-Score: 95.14%

These metrics demonstrate the model's effectiveness in predicting customer interest and its readiness for deployment in a real-world setting.

# Conclusion

This project successfully implemented a machine learning model to forecast customer propensity for vehicle insurance cross-sell offers. The model can optimize marketing efforts and elevate conversion rates.
